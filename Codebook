description of the data: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

My variables:

cnames = the titles for every measurement taken by the original experiment
test_ID = the list of subject ID's associated with each measurement
test_data = the observed data values from the experiment
test_activity = the coded values to the type of activity performed by the user
train_ID = the list of subject ID's associated with each training measurement
train_data = the data values from the training experiment
train_activity = the coded values of the types of activity performed
test_df = a data frame for the column bind of the test data
train_df = a data frame for the column bind of the training data
my_df = the row bind of test_df and train_df

my_subset = selected columns from my_df containing the ID, activity and those columns with mean and standard deviation

tidy_subset = a data frame of the averages for each participants activity
