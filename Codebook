Tasked to format a given dataset into tidy useable data

###Collection of the raw data

description of the data: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones


## My variables:

cnames = the titles for every measurement taken by the original experiment; class = character; 561 different names of types of measurements
test_ID = the list of subject ID's associated with each measurement; class = data frame; consists of 9 unique identifiers
test_data = the observed data values from the experiment; class = data frame; 
test_activity = the coded values to the type of activity performed by the user; class = data frame
train_ID = the list of subject ID's associated with each training measurement; class = character
train_data = the data values from the training experiment; class = data frame
train_activity = the coded values of the types of activity performed; class = data frame
test_df = a data frame for the column bind of the test data; class = data frame
train_df = a data frame for the column bind of the training data; class = data frame
my_df = the row bind of test_df and train_df; class = data frame; size = 10299 x 563

my_subset = selected columns from my_df containing the ID, activity and those columns with mean and standard deviation; class = data frame; size = 10299 x 88

tidy_subset = a data frame of the averages for each participants activity; class = data frame; size = 180 x 88
